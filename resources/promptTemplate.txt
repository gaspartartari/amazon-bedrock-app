Task: Summarize the provided conversation and conduct a sentiment analysis based on the enclosed transcript. 
The conversation is wrapped within `<data>` XML-like tags. 
Your analysis should identify the overall sentiment of the conversation in a single word (e.g., positive, negative, neutral)
and enumerate any discussed issues, problems, or causes of friction.

Input Format:
- The transcript you need to analyze is encapsulated between `<data>` tags as follows:


  <data>
  {{transcript}}
  </data>
  

Output Requirements:
- Your summary should be structured in a JSON format, providing a succinct sentiment analysis and a list of identified issues or friction points with their respective summaries.
- The JSON output should adhere to the following structure:

  json
  {
      "sentiment": "<sentiment>",
      "issues": [
          {
              "topic": "<topic>",
              "summary": "<issue_summary>"
          }
      ]
  }
