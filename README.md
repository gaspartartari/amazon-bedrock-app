# Serverless Conversation Analysis with AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon Bedrock

This project showcases a serverless architecture leveraging AWS Lambda and Amazon S3 for the processing, analysis, and summarization of conversation transcripts. It automates the transcription of audio files uploaded to S3, utilizes Amazon's Bedrock Large Language Models (LLMs) for summarization and sentiment analysis, and stores the results back in S3. This solution was developed as part of a practical learning module in a short course from DeepLearning.AI on cloud computing and machine learning applications.

## Features

- **Serverless Architecture:** Fully managed serverless computing with AWS Lambda for executing application logic without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Automated Audio File Processing:** Uploading audio files to Amazon S3 triggers AWS Lambda functions for transcription and further processing.
- **Advanced Summarization:** Utilizes Amazon Bedrock LLMs for high-quality summarization of transcribed text, extracting key points and sentiment.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the overall sentiment of the conversation, providing insights into emotional tone and customer satisfaction.
- **Amazon S3 Integration:** Leverages Amazon S3 for the robust storage and retrieval of audio files, transcripts, and analytical results.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Audio to S3:** Audio files (.mp3 format) uploaded to a designated S3 bucket automatically trigger a transcription Lambda function.
2. **Transcription with Amazon Transcribe:** The Lambda function processes the audio using Amazon Transcribe to generate a text transcript.
3. **Summarization and Sentiment Analysis:** Another Lambda function, utilizing Amazon Bedrock LLMs, is triggered to summarize the conversation and analyze its sentiment.
4. **Result Storage:** The summarization and sentiment analysis results are stored in S3, readily accessible for review and analysis.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **AWS Account Setup:** Ensure access to AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Bedrock services within your AWS account.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:** Define necessary environment variables for S3 bucket names, IAM roles, and other configurations as required by the code.
3. **Lambda Functions Deployment:** Follow the provided scripts to deploy Lambda functions for handling transcription, summarization, and sentiment analysis tasks.
4. **S3 Bucket Preparation:** Create and configure S3 buckets for storing input audio files, transcripts, and analytical outputs.
